# Running Blue Marble on WINDOWS (.bat file)
*This is for running on WINDOWS.
- (1) Click on "Branch: master" on top left; switch to "batch" branch
- (2) Click on the green "Clone or download" button on top right; click "Download ZIP"
- (3) Extract it; I suggest having all these files in a folder named "BlueMarbleGame" or something
- (4) Go into "bin" folder & double-click "launch.bat" file
- (5) For convenience, create a shortcut to this "launch.bat" file and locate it somewhere much more accessible; I provided the icon for this shortcut outside the "bin" folder ("bluemarblegame.ico").
